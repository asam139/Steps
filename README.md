## Requirements


## Installation

Add this to your project using Swift Package Manager. In Xcode that is simply: File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency... and you're done. Alternative installations options are shown below for legacy projects.

### CocoaPods

If you are already using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), just add 'Steps' to your `Podfile` then run `pod install`.

### Carthage

If you are already using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), just add to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "asam139/Steps" ~> 0.1
```

Then run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Steps`.framework into your Xcode project.
